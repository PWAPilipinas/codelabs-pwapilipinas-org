<h4>Installing Angular CLI and Generating a Project</h4>
<br><br>

<h5>Install Angular CLI</h5>
<p>If you don't have Angular CLI yet,  Open the terminal and install it via npm.</p>
<pre>
npm install -g @angular/cli
</pre>
<br><br>

<h5>Create an Angular CLI Starter Project</h5>
<p>Still in the terminal, generate the starter project. You may choose any app name in replacement of the 'sample-project'.</p>
<pre>
ng new sample-project
</pre>
<p>Follow the instructions and choose the default options if asked. Though you may choose what you prefer. Go through the questions and wait for the dependencies to be installed.</p>
<pre>
? Would you like to add Angular routing? yes
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? CSS
</pre>
<p>Once the installation of dependencies are done, open the directory.</p>
<pre>
cd sample-project
</pre>
<p>You may test if the project works by running a local development server.</p>
<pre>
ng serve
</pre>
<p>It would then be accessible at http://localhost:4200</p>
