<h4>Add Angular PWA</h4>
<p>This is where the magic happens. Once you have your existing or Angular CLI generated template app, we can now start adding the PWA features like service worker, manifest and icons.</p>
<br><br>

<h5>Add @angular/pwa to the project</h5>
<p>Once you're in the directory of the project you just made, add @angular/pwa.</p>
<pre>
ng add @angular/pwa
</pre>
<p>What the command does is modify your project by adding icons, manifest, service worker and theme color to your project.</p>
